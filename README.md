This project focuses on converting Braille to binary and then translating the binary data into readable text using a 16-segment display. The system has potential applications in translating and processing Braille content for the visually impaired.

## Steps:- 

1. Braille to Binary Conversion:- Converts Braille characters into their corresponding binary representations.
  
2. Binary to Text Conversion (16 Segment Display):- Translates binary data into human-readable text using a 16-segment display, allowing for accurate representation of characters.
